 Hey there! Here are some of the things I'm working on these days:

> [Komic](http://komicapp.com) - collaborative comedy writing. In the App Store now. 
> Intro price: free. What? A $20 value absolutely free? Yep. Today only. And if you think
I'll throw in a set of Ginsu knives and an authentic genuine imitation plastic bulletproof selfie stick, you can forget it.
I'm in the market for those items myself.

> [Write Farewell](http://writefarewell.com) - in beta. Possibly the most dangerous app for any office worker.
Once it comes out that is.

Other places I might appear on: Twitter [@zookgek](https://twitter.com/zookgek) and [GitHub](https://github.com/ssarber). Don't be a stranger, say hello or something less friendly, it's all good.
